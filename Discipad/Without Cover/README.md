Discipad Case  

![Discipad Case w/o Cover](https://github.com/lipsticklatitude/3DPrints/blob/master/Discipad/Without%20Cover/IMG_20201107_144549-01.jpeg)

High profile case for the Discipad numpad. The case takes the place of the FR4 bottom plate and uses M2 screws/standoffs. I used 10mm standoffs for the pictured build. The case sits flat. I added rubber feet (https://amzn.to/3l9wXsg) to add a tilt.
