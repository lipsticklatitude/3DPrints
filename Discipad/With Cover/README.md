Discipad case with cover

High profile case for the Discipad numpad. The case takes the place of the FR4 bottom plate and uses M2 screws/standoffs. I used 10mm standoffs for the pictured build. The case sits flat. I added rubber feet ( https://amzn.to/3l9wXsg) to add a tilt. This version features a cover for the internals at the top, with a cutout for the boot and reset buttons. Note, only the bottom 4 standoffs & screws are used so that the top can slide into the case.
